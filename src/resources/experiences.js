      "During my 224-hour On-the-Job Training at the Artificial Intelligence Research Center for Community Development (AIRCoDe), I was part of the Game Development Team under the Disaster Risk Management Division. Our main project was “Demon’s Maze”, a 3D maze-escape game developed using the Godot Engine and GDScript. The game featured AI-driven enemies using A* pathfinding and was showcased at the 13th Bicol Youth Congress in Information Technology (BYCIT) as part of AIRCoDe’s “AI Caravan for Community Development.” I contributed to enemy AI implementation, level design, and UI systems such as health and stamina. This experience sharpened my skills in game programming, team collaboration, and real-world project execution.",
